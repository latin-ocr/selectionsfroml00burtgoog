PREFACE

sought. In referring to Livy, passages included in this
book have been used wherever it was possible; passages
not included are given in full. With the same idea,-
tbat the college undergraduate rarely looks up a reference
not contained in the book heis using,-grammatical ex-
planations are given in the notes, reference to grammars
being in general omitted. The brief bibliography at tbe
beginning of chapters or groups of chapters is inserted
for the convenience of teachers and the possible use of
students

ln the preparation of the notes, the commentary of
the Weissenborn-H. J. Mueller edition has been of con-
stant assistance. Professor Morris of Yale has made many
valuable suggestions. To Professor Morgan of Harvard
Ι arn indebted more than Ι can say; he has read the rnanu-

script carefully‚ and his many scholarly suggestions have

been gratefully accepted.

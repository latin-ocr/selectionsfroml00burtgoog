tion of festivals and sometimes affixed a brief statement of ·

historical information.-The same name (fasti) was ap-

(fasti sacerdotales), and triumphs (fasti triumphales). The

dictators, and magistn' equitum down to about 13 nn, with
a list of triumphs down to about 12 s.c., and a record of
the leodi saeculares, ending with those celebrated under
Domitian. -Of the same nature were the libri lintei, men-

early republican period, there were, for example, the treaty
with Carthage of the year 509, the treaty with the Latins of
the year 493, and the first tribunician law of the same year.
The written information accessible to the early historians
consisted, therefore, in a body of briei statement5‚ in little

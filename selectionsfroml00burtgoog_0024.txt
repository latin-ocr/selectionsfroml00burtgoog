Moreover, meager as this record was, much of it must have
perished in one way or another from time to time, and es-
pecially when Rome was occupied by the Gauls in 390.

Hence, in the historians of the late republic and the empire,
who, for the early period, were simply copying their prede-
cessors,—and copying them often in an uncritical way,
—it is not surprising to find confused and incredible state-

3. Early Roman Historians. - The earliest historiens of
Rome wrote in Greek, because Latin had never been used
for literary prose, and the possibilities of Greek for that
purpose were well known to them. Their productioris were
called annales, a name that indicated the strict chronological
sequence of the narrative. It was their custom to treat

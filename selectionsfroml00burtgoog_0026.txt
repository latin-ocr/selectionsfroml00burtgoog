INTRODUCTION

history much that was false, and tended to make the natu-
rally careless writer more careful in his statements. Still
there was such carelessness in historical writing as would
not now be tolerated. A good example of this is the De Viris
Illustridus oi Cornelius Nepos, —a thoroughly unscholarly
work. When the subject was a contemporary one‚·there
was less probability of error, and the works oi Caesar and
Sallust are in general trustworthy.

5. Titus Livius. - Historical writing reached its highest
point in the latter half of the first century ac, and Titus
Livius is the best representative ol the period. Of the
’ details ol his lile we know little. He was born at Patavium,
in northeastern Italy, probably in 59 ae, but the date rests
only upon a questionable statement of Jerome. His lile
was passed in Rome, where he seems to have been on
intimate terms with Augustus, but 'took no part in public
life. Oi his family relations we know only that he had a
son and a daughter. To the former he probably addressed
a work in epistolary form on rhetorical training. Ἴ He
wrote also, according to Seneca, philosophical works and
dialogues on philosophica] and historical subjects

6. Livy’s History of Rome.-Livy’s great work, the
history of Rome, was begun between 27 and 25 nc, when
he was between thirty and thirty-live years old, and was
continued till his death in 17 ar). The date of composition
ol several books can be approximately determined. The
title appears to have been ab arbe condita libri, though
Livy once refers to his work as annales.¹ Having begun
in the old-fashioned way with the foundation ol the city,
he had at the time of his death written 142 books and
carried the history down to the year 9 ac. Like the an·
nalists he treated the early period in somewhat summary

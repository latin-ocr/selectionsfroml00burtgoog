SELECTIONS FROM LIVY

In Books I-XXX he gives the history ot 550 years3 in Books
XXXI-LXVIII, 100 years; in Books LXIX-CVIII, 50
years; in Books CIX-CXLII, 42 years, Though the work
was not finished at his death, he had published from time
to time sections of varying length.

The early part of the history, 45 books, fell naturally

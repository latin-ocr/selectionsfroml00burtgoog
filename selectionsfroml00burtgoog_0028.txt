ν INTRODUCIION

begin with the Second Punic War and carry the history to ⁸

the end of the Third Macedonian War (219-167 ac). O
the other books onlysmall fragments have been preserved by
later writers, but we have brief summaries (periochae) of all
except Books CXXXVI and CXXXVII, compiled perhaps
in the fourth century au, when the work was still complete.

7. Livy’s Sources.—Minute study oi the work has shown
that Livy made little use oi original documents,-public
records, inscriptions, etc. He apparently did not avail
himself to any extent of the annales maximi and made no
systematic use of the earlier writers, as, for example, Fa·
bius Pictor and Cato. His narrative is based in large part
on the works of later writers, but to what extent he is in-
debted to them individually it is impossible to say with cer-
tainty, as he rarely gives the names oi his authorities.
Those most often mentioned are the following: Valerius
Antias (mentioned thirty-six times in the extant books),
whose work was similar to Livy’s, covering the complete
history of Rome in at least 75 books; Claudius Quadriga·
rius, who began his history with the Gallie invasion (see on
9, 5, 2); Licinius Macer, who was more reliable than many
oi his contemporaries and predecessors, in that he con-
sulted original sources, ag. the libri lintei ,· L. Calpurnius
Piso, consul in 133, whose history, beginning with Aeneas,
was brought down at least to the year 1463 and Coelius
Antipater, whose excellent history of the Second Punic
War hasbeen already mentioned. But Livy’s great au-
thority for one oi the most important parts oi his work,
the Second and Third Punic Wars and the wars with Mace-
donia, was Polybius· Though heis mentioned by name .
only rive times, the extant books of Polybius show Livy’s
indebtedness to him.

SELECTIONS FROM LlVll

8. Livy’s Historical Value; his Style. — Taking into ac-
count the nature of his sources, the enormous extent of his
work, and the standard ol his time, we must regard Livy
as a fairly carelul and accurate historian. His work, he
V says (9, 17, ι), is not intended merely to give pleasure to

the reader. He fully realized the insufficiency of his evi-
dence, especially ior the earlier period ; in 6, 1, 2, speaking
of the early history oi the city, he says, res cnm uetustate
nimia obscuras, velut qnae magno er interuallo loci uir cer-

Elsewhere (ι, 8, 5; 8, 6, 3; 8, 40, 4), he suggests that the
facts as he finds them have been intentionally misstated.
‘ He himself was anxious to discover and to state the truth.
He did not lack industry, but did not attempt a decision
where none was possible, 7, 6, 6, cura non deesset, si qna
ad uernm via inquirentem ferret. In using the writings ol
his predecessors, he weighed the probability of their state-
ments; where there were conflicting stories, he accepted
that which appeared to him most probable. He possessed
alarge fund oi that quality which is most valuable to a
historian-common sense; it was this which made him
look askance at the legends of the early city (see Praef 6 ff.)
and in his later books reject the absurd exaggerations ol
Valerius Antias.
But, whatever may be said oi its historical accuracy, the
, great merit oi Livy’s history is the fact that it is always
’ readable,—often intensely interesting. The thought is
clear, the style simple. The sentences are usually short,
the structure rarely complicated. The thought, not the

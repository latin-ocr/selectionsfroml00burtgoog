ad diruendam urbem. Quae ubi intravere portas, non qui· 2
dem fuit tumultus ille nec pavor, qualis captarum esse ur-
bium solet, cum effractis portis stratisve ariete muris aut
arce vi capta clamor hostilis et cursus per urbem armatorum
omnia ferro flammaque miscet; sed silentium triste ac 3
tacita maestitia ita delixit omnium animos, ut prae metu
[obliti]‚ quid relinquerent, quid secum ferrent, deficiente
consilio rogitantesque alii alios nunc in liminibus starent,
nunc errabundi domos suas ultimum illud visuri pervaga-
rentur. Vt vero iam equitum clamor exire iubentium 4
instabat, iam fragor tectorum quae diruebantur ultimis

the ability to write passages of this 3. silentium . . . maestitia:

sort which distinguishes the in-
telligent and appreciative historiari
from the mechanical and uninter-
esting annalist. The silent de-
spair of the Albans (expressed in
all its intensity by silentium triste
ac lucela nimmia), as'they wan-
dered about looking upon their
homes for the last time, the distant
noise of falling houses, the arrival
of the hostile cavalry, and finally
the sad procession, -it is all told
with simplicity, but with a sug-
gestiveness which stirs the imag-
inatlon and makes a distinct
impression upon the mind.

and, lor the thought, 25, 31, 9. - .

clamor hostilis et cursus . . . arma·
torum: clamantes hostes et cur-
rentes armati5 the reading of the
text, however, emphasizes the act
rather than 'the actor ; cf. § 4eque'·
· tum clam0r; so in 1, 13, zdirzinere
iras ( = z'ratos).

there is no difference between the
two ideaS, except that in the former
silence is emphasized, in the latter
sedness. -prae = propter3 but in
classical Latin in this sense it is
always used ol a preventive cause.
lts proper force may sometimes be
retained by translating in view of
or in sace of. -obliti: the diffi-
culty of explaining the word ln its
proper sense makes it probable
that it is an interpolation, the
following indirect questions would
thus depend upon deficiente consilii)
and rogitantes. This practical de-
tail adds much to the realityof the
picture. -rogitantesz a frequenta-
tive almost unknown outside os
Plautus and Terence, but here very
effective- domos: the object ol
ventri and pervagarentury cl.

SELECTIONS FROM LIVY

tempus suspensos ita tenuit animos usque ad lucem alte·
ram, ut identidem iam in urbem futurus videretur impetus:
primo adventu, quia accesserant ad urbem—mansuros
7enim ad Aliam fuisse, nisi hoc consili foret; deinde sub
· occasum soliS, quia haud multum diei supererat, ante
noctem rati invasuros; tum in noctem dilatum consilium
8esse, quo plus pavoris inferrent ; postremo lux adpro-
pinquans exanimare3 timorique perpetuo ipsum malum
continens fuit, cum signa infesta portis sunt inlata. Ne-
quaquam tamen ea nocte neque insequenti die similis illi
9 quae ad Aliam tam pavide fugerat civitas fuit. Nam cum
defendi urbem posse tam parva relicta manu spes nulla ·
esset, placuit cum coniugibus ac liberis iuventutem milita·
rem senatusque robur in arcem Capitoliumque concedere

6. identidem: they constantly
found reason to fear that the
attack would occur immediately
(rant). zderrtt'dem is explained in
the following words by reference
to four successive periods.—
primo adventu: sc. futurus orde-
batur elimetur—mansuros . . .
foret: ind. disc, justified by the
idea of thinking implied in vi·
deretan- the ind. disc. is contin-
ued in the two following clauseS,
but, as if to explain their relation
to the sentence, rati (stunt) is
inserted.

7. sub occasum solis: soon after
their arrival, for they reached the
city not long before sunset; see
ξ 2. For the meaning of snb see
on 7, 31, 5. -invasuros: sc. hostes
as subject.

8. exanimare: historical infini-

tiva-continens fuit: followed
close upum lit., was aciyhz'm'ng.
Cf. 37, 40, 6 corrtz'nens bis grex
sedecim elephantorum-similis
. . . civitas: cf. 5, 38, 5.—pavide:
Livy has used here a very rare ad·
verb when he might have used the
adjective.

9. senatusque robur: the
younger senators, whose aid in
defense of the Capitoline would
be valuable.-arcem capitolium-
que: the arx was the northern
summit of the Capitoline Hill; the
name Capitolium was applied to
the whole hill, but also especially,
as here, to the southern summit.
On the former was the temple of
Juno, the latter was almost entirely
occupied hythe great temple of
Jupiter, cf. ξ 12 sedes deorum.

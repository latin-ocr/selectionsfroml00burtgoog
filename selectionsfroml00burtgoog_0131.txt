7. atriis: the atrium was the
large central room in the front
part of the house, into which the
surrounding rooms opened. lt
was reached lrom the street bya
short passage, and could be easily
seen lrom the street when the front
door was open.

8. adeo: introducing thereason
sorthe preceding statement, cf. 2,
27, 3.-in aediumvestibulis: there
has been much discussion as to the
meaning of vestibulum it seems
best taken as meaning a space be-
tween the front door and the street,
-a very small space if it was due
only td the slight recession of the
front doorway, but larger if the
house had wings projecting toward
the street. tf the sront line of the
house was absolutely unbrolren,
there was no vestibulum. See 2,
49, 3 consul paludatus in vestibulo
gentem onmem suam instructo ag-
minevrdet. The word is best taken

here in its proper sense 3 the Gauls
hesitated to enter because of the
impressive dignity of the old men
sitting before their houses. lf this
is correct, we must admit that
medab aedium in ξ 2 is an incon·
sistency, unless it could mean

, the space between two project-

ing wings. -prae se ferebat: dis·
flayed—dis: see on Praes. 8.

9. simulacra: used especially of
statues of the gods-Gallo: 'see
on 1, 5, 6 ltlumz'lori. —suamt re-
ferring to the subject of the main
verb, without regard to the parti-
ciple permulcenli,· cf. 2, 1, ase. —
scipione eburneo: those who had
had a triumph carried an ivory
staff decorated with a golden
crown of oak leaves, or, later,
with the eagle.—-initium caedis
ortum: for the pleonasm cl. Praes.
12. ortum and trucidatos are in
ind. disc, as ir dz'citur had been
used impersonally.

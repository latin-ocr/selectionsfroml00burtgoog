tus ergo Alexander cum invictis ducibus bella gessisset et
eadem fortunae pignora in discrimen detulisset; immo rs
etiam eo plus periculi subisset, quod Macedones unum
Alexandrum habuissent, multis casibus non solum obno-
xium sed etiam offerentem se, Romani multi fuissent Ale· 19
xandro vel 'gloria vel rerum magnitudine pares, quorum suo
quisque fato sine publico discrimine viveret morereturque.

19. Restat ut copiae copiis conparentur vel numero vel 1
militum genere vel multitudine auxiliorum. Censebantur
eius aetatis lustris ducena quinquagena milia capitum.¹

circumsta‘nbes they might find
their own army weak and dis·
couraged, the enemy confident.

16. domini: Demos. Olynth. 1
4 says of Alexander, τὸ γὰρ εἶναι
πάντων ἐκεῖνον ἕνα ὄντα κύριον καὶ
ῥητῶν κᾶποῤῥήτων καὶ ἅμα στρα-
τηγὸν καὶ δεσπότην καὶ ταμὼν.-
trahunt: contr0l3 cf. 1, 7, 1.—
consiliis: sc. suth-secuntur: sc.
altorum consilia.

17. invictus ergo . to be
referred to the whole of the argu-
ment,not to the part of it imme-
diatelypreceding3 otherwise, ergo
would appear somewhat illogical.
At the best, the sentence is abrupt.
For invictus = revincible see on
24, 34, 9 retacta—eadem. . .
detulisset: would have pledged tlte
same stokes on the result.

19. vel . . . magnitudine: the
two things are not mutually ex·
clusive, as they would have been
is aut had been used. The use of

wel indicates that the reader may
choose his point of comparison. —
rerum: sc. gestarum—suo tato:
suo is emphatic; tle. a fate that
was distinctly his own, one which
would have no permanent influence
on the destiny os the state.—
morereturque: see on 9, 6, 2 neca·
tique and cf. ξ 13 vicenosqrte,· the
meaning is, One ought lewe or die.

19. 1. eius aetatis: the period
of ¹Alexander's activity. ln view
of the plural lustris and the num-
ber of citizens, which is evidently
an indefinite one, it is apparent
that Livy is not referring to a par· Ι
ticular censuS, but to the whole
period of Alexander's campaigns.
—lustris : the purificatory sacrifice,
which regularly, though not always,
followed the taking of the census,
—an institution of ,Servius Tul·

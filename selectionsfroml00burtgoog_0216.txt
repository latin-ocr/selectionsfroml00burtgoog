here and primus in the next clause
would have been more natural.
princeps gives, however, a local
idea which primas would not have
given. Nep05, Haun. 3, 1 says
that Hannibal commanded all the
cavalry.

9. viri virtutes . . . vitia: a
notable instance 01 alliteration 3 the
use 01 vz'ri is due partly to Livy's
fondness for alliteration, but it em·
phasizes at the same time the con·
trast between the virtues which
were and the vices which were not
worthy 01 a great nran3 01. 9, 8,
rr.——crudelitas: Polyb. 9, 22, 7
and 9, 26. 11 states that Hannibal
was charged by the Romans with
cruelty‚ by the Carthaginians with

avarice. It is remarkable thatin
this careful characterization Livy
does not mention avarice, a fault
which he, too, elsewhere ascribes
to Hannibal. In contrast with the
unqualified assertion 01 inhumana
crudelitas are several passages (eg,
22, 7, 5) in which Hannibal’s clem·
ency is illustrated. Mommsen
says, “Nothing occurs in the ac·
counts regarding him which may
not bejustified in the circumstances
and according to the international
law 01 the times.’'- perfidia: the
perfidy 01 the Carthaginians was
proverbial among the Romans.-

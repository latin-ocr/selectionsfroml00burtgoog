30. Itaque Hannibal, postquam ipsi sententia stetit per· 1
gere ire atque Italiam petere, advocata contione varie mili·
turn versat animos castigando adhortandoque: mirari se, 2
quinam pectora semper inpavida repens terror invaserit.
Per tot annos vincentis eos stipendia facere neque ante
Hispania excessisse quam omnes gentesque et terrae quas
duo diversa maria amplectantur Carthaginiensium essent. '
Indignatus deinde, quod, quicumque Saguntum obsedissent 3
velut ob ,noxam sibi dedi postularet populus Romanus Hi·
berum traiecisse ad delendum nomen Romanorum liberan-
dumque orbem terrarum. Tum nemini visum id longum, 4

the construction cf. 21, 29, 5
‚ Scipioni. —pergere ire: cf. 9, 2, 8.
-castigando adhortandoque:
these words describe the two equal
parts into which the speech is di-
vided,-the first part occupying
§5 2—6, the second ἐξ 7-11. This
speech is one of ‘the best in Livy,
and as an example os careful ar-
rangement and concentrated elo-
quence is hardly surpassed. There
is nota useless sentence, scarcely
a phrase which does not contribute
to the effectiveness of the climax.
Hannibal points out the absurdity
of his soldiers' sear, in view of the
more difficult things which they
have already accomplished; he
encourages them to think that the
Alps are by uo means impassable ;
and finally calls attention to the
prize which awaits them at the end
of the journey.

2. quinam: seeon 9, 17,2.-
stipendia facere: had served, the
pres. indicating that the service

still continued 3 cf. our phrase, to
vrrakemoney. —omnes . . . essent:
an exaggeration3 only the south-
ern part of the peninsula and the
eastern part as far north as the
Ebro were in the power of Car·
thage. — gentesque et terrae: cor-
relative use osque and et as in
Praef. 13.-diversa: opposite.

, 3. indignatos: shrewdly in-
serted‚ to re·kindle their resent-
ment ς the position gives force to
the word. - quicumque . . . dedi:
during. the siege oi Saguntum
Rome had sent envoys to Hanni-
bal to expostulate: when they
were not received by him, they
went on to Carthage and demanded
that Hannibal and his councillors
be surrendered for punishment
(21, r8,4; Polyb. 3, 20, 8); the
present statement, like that of 21,
44, 4 is an exaggeration. -dedi:
sc. the subject eos, which is also'
the antecedent of pratumque.—
nomen Romanorum: usually nornen ,

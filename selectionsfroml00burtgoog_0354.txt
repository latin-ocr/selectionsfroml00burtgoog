certamen ortum. P. Scipioni Africano, ut Valerius Antias 5
auctor est, duo Q. Petillii diem dixerunt. Id, prout cuius-
que ingenium erat, interpretabantur. Alii non tribunos 6
plebis, sed universam civitatem, quae id pati posset, incusa-
bant: duas maximas orbis terrarum urbes ingratas uno 7
prope tempore in principes inventas, Romam ingratiorem,
si quidem victa Carthago victum Hannibalem in exilium
expulisset, Roma victrix victorem Africanum expellat.
Alii, neminem unum civem tantum eminere debere, ut legi· 8

⁵· Valerius Antias: seelntrod.
7.— Q. Petillii: Dio Cassius, ir.
70, says they were ἀδελφοί (broth-
ers or, possibly, cousins) ; accord-
ing to Plut. Cato Major 15, it was
Cato who induced them to bring
the charge. Only one could le-
gally appear as plaintiff, and only
one is mentioned by Polybius and
Aurelius Victor· There is much
confusion in ancient writers regard-
ing this trial and the end of Scipio's
life3 38, 56, 2 non de accusatore
convenit-alii M. Naevium, alii
Petillios diem dixisse scribunt-,
non de tempore quo dicio dies sit,
non de anno quo mortuus sit, non
ubi mortuus aut elatus sit. Alii
Romae, alii Literni ei mortuum ei
sepultum. Gell. 4, 18 gives Nae·

vius as the plaintifl. The confu-
sion is probably due to the fact
that there were two distinct prose-
cutionS, the first brought by the
Petillii against L. Scipio, the sec-
ond by Naevius against Africanus.
lf the date of the tribuneship of
Naevius is correctly given by Livy
39, 52, 4, this second prosecution
did no't occur till 185. - diem dixe·

7. Carthago . . . expulisset:
Hannibal's political enemies in
Carthage reported to the Romans
that he was trying to induce Antio·
chus, king os Syria, to make war
upon Rome. On the approach of
Roman envoys he fled to Antio-
chus at Ephesus. This was in
193. He never returned to Car·

astriking instance of the freedom
which Livy allowed himself in the
sequence of tenses; see on 1, 27,

ceding victe . . . Hannibalem.

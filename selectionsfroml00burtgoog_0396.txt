Professor Emeritos ol Latin. llerverd Unlverslty

INCE its first publication this work has been used more

widely than any other Latin grammar for advanced study

and reference. It is approached by no other American
publication in completeness and authoritativeness. and is con-
spicuous for its originality, sound scholarship, accurate analysis
of constructions, copious illustrations, and clear arrangement.
The revision has been conducted under the direction of Professor
Morris H. Morgan, who edited and completed the original
edition, left unfinished by the death of the distinguished author.
The chapter on Sound has been rewritten·and enlarged by
Professor Hanns Oertel, of Yale‚ and the views concerning the
nature and kinds of vowels and consonants‚ the Latin accent,
and the phonetic laws under which changes of vowel and con-
sonant should take place, have been modified to conform to
present usage. Many changes have also been made in the
chapter on inflection and Formation. Throughout the book the
working of “hidden quantfties” has been completely revised.
For the most part, however, no alterations have been found
necessary in the treatment of broad general principles or in the
method of presentation.

ᾖ

The works of Latin Litcrature 01 the post-Augustan
period have hithert0, with a few notable exceptionS, been
virtually excludcd from the classical curricula of colleges
and universities

The present collection has been made primarily 101 the
use of students in higher classes in colleges. The selec·
11015 will be found useful as collateral reading in con-
nection with lectures on classical literature, and will also
furnish suitable material for sight reading.

The selections themselves contain nothing that is not
eminently worthy of perusal. They are in every case
sufficiently extensive to give a continuous ‘and coherent
story, which at the same time exhibits the author at his
best. The text follows the best modern editions, the
deviations from the standard texts being hriefly recorded
in critical appendices

Capiet sent, prepar'd, to any address on receipt of tle price.

This work is designed as a text-book for the use oi
students in Universities and CollegeS, and also to iurnish
an account oi this branch oi archaeological study for
general readers. It has been prepared in the belief that
a knowledge of epigraphy forms au essential part of the
equipment of a toacher oi the classics, and that the sub-
ject itseli has become so important as to justify its intro-
duction‚ in elementary form at least, into the curriculum
oi undergraduate studies.

A distinctive feature of the book is the number and
character of its illustrations‚—there being over seven
hundred cuts and diagrams oi inscriptions ior the pur· ’
pose of illustrating the text, and for practice in reading.
Of these, over'one hundred are photographic repro-
ductions, showing the forms of the letters and the
arrangement oi the inscriptions. The work is also sup·
plied with an exhaustive bibliography and valuable tables
oi abbreviations‚ archaisms‚ etc.

Copias os Egbert's Latin Inscriptions will bc sent, prepared, lo any ¹ada'ress
on recetpt of tlte price by the Publishers .·

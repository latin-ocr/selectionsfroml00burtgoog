This work gives a representative survey of Latir'r Lit-
erature, intended to be read in advanced academie or
college work, as supplementary to a regular course in
Latin Literature, or to be itself the fundamental work
in such a course. The selections range from the popular
songs which antedate written literature, to the Christian
hymns of the third century, covering the early dramatists,
historians, orators, philosopherS, the writers of satire and
epigram, the lyric and epic poets, the collectors of anec-
dotes, letter writers, and authors of prose works, and
including other material of a popular nature, such as
lampoons, parodies, epitaphs, advertisements, announce-
ments of ball games, theatrical and gladiatorial notices,
etc. To each selection is prefixed a concise account of
the author, when known, and of his works, with a brief
‚bibliography. For convenience in sight reading the text
is provided with a translation of the more difficolt words,
and is followed bya fuller commentary on special points
of interest.

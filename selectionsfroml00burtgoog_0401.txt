THIS edition of Horace’s lyrical poems has been
prepared for the needs of freshmen and sopho-

, mores. The introduction is intended to give the
necessary information as to the poet’s life and writ-
ings. The text is the vulgate, although in some
passages the better manuscript edition has been pre·
ferred. lnasmuch as young students require no little
help if they are to understand as well as translate the
Odes and Epodes‚ the editor has not limited his com·
mentary to the baldest aids‚ but has tried to give
such assistance in interpretation as may help students
to some appreciation of Horace's art and charm.
The relation of the poet to his Greek rnodels is
shown by frequent quotations. To all the more
difficult Greek passages translations have been ap·

pended. A number of quotations from the later
’ Latin writers are also given to indicate in some
degree the ready acceptanee which Horace’s phrases
found among his successors.
